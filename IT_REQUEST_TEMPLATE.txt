                        TIPS FOR FASTER APPROVAL:

1. Emphasize "internal use only" - no external exposure
2. Mention it's a "pilot program" - easier to approve
3. Explain business benefits - reduced HR workload
4. Offer to demonstrate the chatbot to IT if they want to see it
5. Be flexible on timeline - "whenever convenient" gets faster response
6. CC your manager on the request - shows management support
